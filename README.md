# Projeto do curso Testes automatizados com Cypress - Básico

👋 Welcome!

It is great to have you here.
I am sure you are going to love this project ❤️

## About

This is the project of the Customer Service Central system of the company Talking About Testing (CAC-TAC), provided as a practical activity to students in the Automated Testing with Cypress - Basic course, taught by Walmyr Filho.

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Git, Visual Studio Code, Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions `2.34.1`, `1.85.1`, `v16.13.2` and `8.3.2` of Git, VS Code, Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

## Instalation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

You can run the tests simulating a desktop or mobile viewport.

### Desktop

Run `npm test` (or `npm t` for the short version) to run the test in headless mode on a desktop viewport.

Or, run `npm run cy:open` to open Cypress in interactive mode.

### Mobile

Run `npm test:mobile` to run the test in headless mode on a mobile viewport.

Or, run `npm run cy:open:mobile` to open Cypress in interactive mode.
