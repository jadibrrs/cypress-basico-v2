# Projeto do curso Testes automatizados com Cypress - Básico

👋 Welcome!

It is great to have you here.
I am sure you are going to love this project ❤️

## About

This is the project of the Customer Service Central system of the company Talking About Testing (CAC-TAC), provided as a practical activity to students in the Automated Testing with Cypress - Basic course, taught by Walmyr Filho.

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Git, Visual Studio Code, Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions 2.34.1, 1.85.1, v16.13.2 and 8.3.2 of Git, VS Code, Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

## Instalation

Run npm install (or npm i for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

> Note: Before running the tests, make a copy of the cypress.env.example.json file as cypress.env.json, which in the real world, you would update with valid credentials.

> The cypress.env.json file is included on .gitignore and you're safe that confidential info won't be versioned.

Run npm test (or npm t for the short version) to run the test in headless mode.

Or, run npm run cy:open to open Cypress in interactive mode.
